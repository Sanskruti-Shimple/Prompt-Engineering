5 years


<b>Output: - <b>
Thank you for providing the loan tenure of 5 years. Now, let's calculate the interest for a loan of Rs. 5 lakh at the specified interest rates for each bank:

1. HDFC Bank: At an interest rate of 8.40% for 5 years, the interest amount can be calculated using the formula:
   Interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Time
   Therefore, the interest for HDFC Bank would be:
   Interest = 5,00,000 * 8.40% * 5
                  = Rs. 2,10,000

2. UCO Bank: At an interest rate of 9.00% for 5 years, the interest amount can be calculated using the same formula:
   Interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Time
   Therefore, the interest for UCO Bank would be:
   Interest = 5,00,000 * 9.00% * 5
                  = Rs. 2,25,000

3. Bank of India: At an interest rate of 8.65% for 5 years, the interest amount can be calculated as follows:
   Interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Time
   Therefore, the interest for Bank of India would be:
   Interest = 5,00,000 * 8.65% * 5
                  = Rs. 2,16,250

4. ICICI: At an interest rate of 8.75% for 5 years, the interest amount can be calculated using the formula:
   Interest = Principal * Interest Rate * Time
   Therefore, the interest for ICICI would be:
   Interest = 5,00,000 * 8.75% * 5
                  = Rs. 2,18,750

Please note that these calculations provide an estimate of the interest amount for each bank based on the given interest rates and loan tenure. The actual interest rates and terms may vary based on the specific policies and conditions of the respective banks. It's always recommended to reach out to the banks directly for accurate and up-to-date information on their loan offerings.
